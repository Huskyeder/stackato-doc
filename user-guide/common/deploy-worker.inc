Worker Applications
-------------------

Non-HTTP apps that run as a Stackato application under the control of the 
Health Manager.

To deploy worker applications, you need to use the 
:ref:`command <stackato_yml-command>` key and set the 
:ref:`proceses: web <stackato_yml-processes-web-null>` key to Null ("~").
