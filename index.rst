`Stackato <http://www.activestate.com/cloud>`_ is polyglot
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) software. You can run it in your own data
center using the hypervisor of your choice, or on your favorite cloud
hosting provider to provide a private or public PaaS.

Documentation is provided for two different, but sometimes overlapping
audiences:

* Stackato Users: Developers and other end users who will be using a
  PaaS set up and maintained by others.
* Stackato Admins: System operators in charge of setting up,
  configuring, and maintaining the PaaS
